# generate_random_num
### _Training project_

My training project in which I implemented a simple application that generates random numbers in a given range. In the process of implementation, 
I used the knowledge ___HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.___ 

During the implementation process, we handled __errors__ such as: 
* Setting the minimum and maximum values 
* You cannot leave the field empty 
* The first number must be greater than the second
